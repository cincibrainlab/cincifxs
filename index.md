# Our approach to Fragile X Syndrome
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) represents the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism, affecting approximately 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 individuals in the general population. About two-thirds of individuals with FXS have a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS affects the X chromosome, specifically on the FMR1 gene; therefore, more males are diagnosed with FXS than females. Diagnosis of FXS is made through a DNA (blood) test. Cincinnati Fragile X Research and Treatment Center, located at Cincinnati Children's and led by Craig Erickson, MD, serves males and females of all ages affected by FXS.

Since there is no cure for FXS, treatment focuses on improving the quality of life for the patient and family, which includes management of symptoms. An interdisciplinary team has been developed to provide an individualized level of treatment for each patient. The Fragile X Research and Treatment Center provides educational materials, behavioral medication management, behavioral and cognitive assessment, and behavior therapy interventions. Referrals for other services including speech therapy, occupational therapy, special education consultation, and genetic counseling, are available.

# Available Non-Drug Studies  (in age order)
For our non-drug studies, in most cases we are enrolling human subjects who match the age and sex of patients with fragile X to serve as "control" or comparison subjects. Specific testing and games vary per study. 

## Infant and Toddler Brain Function Study 
Who: Infants and young toddlers with FXS 
What: Multiple language measures & assessments, EEG, fNIRS
Why: This study uses a cap that monitors blood flow and electrical activity in the brain while the participant listens to sounds. The study’s goal is to find a link between brain activity and language impairment.
 
## MRI Brain Imaging 
Who: Any child over 3 months old with FXS 
What: MRI, EEG, cognitive/developmental testing, blood draw (optional)
Why: This study’s goal is to learn more about brain structure, function, and development in people with developmental disabilities.  

## Characterizing the Biology of FXS 
Who: Anyone 
What: A wide variety of optional tasks, including blood draws, cognitive testing, neuropsychological games, parent measures, EEG, MRI, eye tracking tasks  
Why: The purpose of this study is to help us understand the biology of FXS by comparing data from people with FXS to typically developing individuals and individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders. 

## FORWARD MARCH Study   
Who: People with FXS born between 2003 and 2017 
What: Parent measures, cognitive testing and clinician forms during regularly scheduled clinic visits
Why: The purpose of this research study is to create a way to collect and combine data about people with fragile X syndrome (FXS) from clinics across the United States. This data will help establish the best ways to evaluate and treat people with FXS.

## Computer Based Cognitive Testing 
Who: People 4+ years old who have intellectual disabilities 
What: Parent measures, cognitive testing, neuropsychological games 
Why: The goal of this study is to develop ways to measure cognition, in hopes we can use these in future clinical trials to help us understand which treatments work. 

## New Parent-Report Measure of Inflexibility in FXS
Who: Caregiver of individual with FXS
What: Parent measures
Why: Behavioral inflexibility is common in FXS and greatly impacts daily life. We developed a measure to better capture this symptom and need to test it out.

## EEG Study of Brain Activity 
Who: People 8-12 years old or 18+ with FXS and IQ < 85 OR typically developing controls 
What: Clinical assessments, parent measures, cognitive testing, neuropsychological games, EEG and eye tracking tasks 
Why: This study is looking at how the brain works and changes over time in FXS. It is a correlational study that enrolls individuals with FXS, their family members, and control groups.

## Study of Cognition and Language in Adults with FXS 
Who: Right-handed people 18-36 years old with FXS and IQ <70 
What: Blood draw, parent measures, cognitive and language testing, neuropsychological games, and EEG tasks  
Why: This study’s goal is to better understand the brain basis of specific cognitive and language impairments in FXS. 

## Study of Visual Perception in Males with FXS  
Who: Males with FXS 18-55 years old with IQ < 75 
What: Parent measures, cognitive testing, and EEG tasks 
Why: This study aims to learn more about how distracting sensory stimuli impact behavior and brain activity. 

# Available Drug Trials (in age order)

## Study of BPN14770 in FXS 
Who: Males aged 12-18 years old with FXS 
What: Blood draws, Covid-19 test, ECG, cognitive testing and parent measures  
Why: The main goal of this study is to learn how a study drug is absorbed and circulated in the body. 
 
## Single Dose Drug Challenge Study 
Who: Enrolls people with FXS aged 18-45 years old, IQ < 85, stable psychotropic drugs for 4 weeks 
What: Parent measures, cognitive testing, neuropsychological games, and EEG tasks 
Why: This study is looking to see if medications can impact brain activity in FXS. Three medications (Baclofen, Memantine, Roflumilast) and a placebo will be tested.
